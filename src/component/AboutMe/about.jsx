                Beyond my academic journey as a final-year BCom Information Systems student, I am a problem-solver at heart, passionate about building technology that makes a difference. I thrive on challenges that push me to think creatively and grow both technically and personally. My commitment to continuous improvement has led me to refine my skills in software development, teamwork, and innovation. This portfolio is not just a showcase of my workâ€”it's a reflection of my journey, aspirations, and the impactful solutions I aim to create in the tech world.
